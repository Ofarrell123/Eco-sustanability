        <h2> What is sustanability and why is it so important?</h2>
        <p id="colorChangeParagraph"> First of all, sustanability refers to the practice of protecting our environment
            through sustainable actions and preserving our natural resources. Sustainability is a concept that has been
            around
            for a long time, but it has only recently been adopted. Sustanibility is important as it ensures we do not
            eratically consume all of the resources on earth, leaving it dry. Below is a video which explores the
            importance
            of this topic further. </p>

            <h3> What will happen if we neglect sutanable practices ? </h3>
            <p> Neglecting sustaianble practices can have a huge negative affect on the economy, society and on the
                overall environment. Some of these negative affects are already noticeable. For an example Ignoring
                sustainable actions can lead to very poor air quality, damaging the residents of a city. This is visible
                in Beijing. As you can see above the air quality varies from moderate to very poor, affecting all
                residents residing here. </p>
